Current Work
============

RectParameter to use width  and height (calculate right and top/bottom automatically)

Pose tab to have a list of costumes using it
	Also a button to create a new Costume from that pose

TextureTab
	Show the texture, with rectangles for each of the Poses using that texture.
		Maybe just bottom left and top right corner to show the rectangle.
		Click to show rect figures as Parameters
		Double Click to edit the pose
		Cross hairs at the offset point of each pose
		Buttons to change the outline and cross hair colour.

	Drag a rectangle shown in a different colour.
		Double Click to create a NEW pose

BUGS
====

Not loading the background color from a .scene file.

New Features
============

Costumes to inherit?
	Just the events?

Cannot yet describe a scene with two views of the same stage (used for 2 player split screen)
	Nor can a view be positioned in the middle of a resizable window.

Add some "solid" objects, and use overlap detection to kill the sparks.


Fonts
	Allow loading of multiple ranges of characters.

View clipping.

Merge scenes from two or more scene files

The Resources Editor

Tags
	Consider special methods on Tagged and TagManager to use inline reified typed methods to return Roles of the
		specified type.
	Maybe also using a Class as the tag.
	How about finding roles with tag x AND tag y. Tag x OR tag y?
		Or should this be done by the client?
	Nearby - Only return those in a the surrounding N blocks.
		N=0 when it will be used for collision detection.
		Create a new TaggedRole interface.

SceneResource to have a set of "includes", so that merging multiple .scene files is done automatically.

Later
=====

JBox2d integration

Auto detection of a grid to aid splitting a texture into Pose's rectangles.

Split the project into multiple modules
	core
	demo
	editor

Load pose meta-data from SVG files.
	Any objects with a name pose_XXX, where XXX is the pose name.
	Can get the offesetX,Y from the object's center of rotation.
	Can still use GIMP, by linking pngs and exporting the pngs from GIMP.

Scene Editor


Much Later
==========

When adding an actor to a scene, also add child actors as dictated by the costume

StageConstraint

New Game Wizard
	Choice of a completely blank project, or a "Hello World"
	Hello World will have a font, a Play director and a Splash director
		Splash will display some simple text and a button to lauch "level01"
		Maybe also have a "Me" Role

Code Templates
	Create one of Director, Role, Tags
