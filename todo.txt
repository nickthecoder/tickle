BUGS
====

Not loading the background color from a .scene file.

New Features
============

Cannot yet describe a scene with two views of the same stage (used for 2 player split screen)
	Nor can a view be positioned in the middle of a resizable window.

Add some "solid" objects, and use overlap detection to kill the sparks.


Fonts
	Allow loading of multiple ranges of characters.

View clipping.

Merge scenes from two or more scene files

The Resources Editor

Tags
	Consider special methods on Tagged and TagManager to use inline reified typed methods to return Roles of the
		specified type.
	Maybe also using a Class as the tag.
	How about finding roles with tag x AND tag y. Tag x OR tag y?
		Or should this be done by the client?
	Nearby - Only return those in a the surrounding N blocks.
		N=0 when it will be used for collision detection.
		Create a new TaggedRole interface.

SceneResource to have a set of "includes", so that merging multiple .scene files is done automatically.

Load pose meta-data from SVG files.
	Any objects with a name pose_XXX, where XXX is the pose name.

	Can still use GIMP, by linking pngs and exporting the pngs from GIMP.
