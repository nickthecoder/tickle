BUGS
====

Not loading the background color from a .scene file.

New Features
============

Editor
	Poses should be child tree items under their texture (as well as a top-level)

	Edit Costume
	Delete texture, pose, costume, input, layout or scene.
	Rename a costume, or scene.
	Add resources of all types.

	When renaming an item, who's name is used in a scene, we need to keep track of renamed items,
		and update all scenes when the resource file is saved.
		Costume and Font only?

	Texture
		Change "View" button to open a new tab (instead of launching gwenview)
		Show the texture, with rectangles for each of the Poses using that texture.
			Maybe just bottom left and top right corner to show the rectangle.
			Click to show rect figures as Parameters
			Double Click to edit the pose
			Cross hairs at the offset point of each pose
			Buttons to change the outline and cross hair colour.

		Drag a rectangle shown in a different colour.
			Double Click to create a NEW pose
			Show non-transparent pixels by drawing the outline in a different color at those places.

		Or click on a point, and look for a transparent rectangular outline which encloses that point to
			define the pose's rect.
			Start with a small square
			Extend along X until both edges are transparent, then switch to Y
			Extend along Y until both edges are transparent, check left/right again and repeat till done.

		Can use a regular canvas for this (load the texture's image again).
		Replace the main window's left pane with a list of Poses using that texture.
			Accordian?

		Edit : If there is an svg or xcf of the same name, edit that instead of the png.

	Ctrl+F to search for resources matching the name (glob?)
		Another TreeView using Accordian?

	Exapand/Contract All rightButtons above the accordian

	Pose tab to have a list of costumes using it
		In a "minor tab"?
		Also a button to create a new Costume from that pose

	Preferences (saved in resources?)
		Image view
		Image editors (one value per extension)

	Custom lauchers (saved in prefernces) - Use it to open the game's paratask project.

MouseInput
	MouseButtonInput
	Hide the mouse, so it can be replaced by an actor
	Action(s) to follow the mouse
		Follow immediately or with "inertia".
	Find Actors at a point
		Overlapping, or using pixel data

Ensure Textures are deleted when removed from resources (Use finialise?).


Costumes to inherit?
	Just the events?

Add some "solid" objects, and use overlap detection to kill the sparks.


Fonts
	Allow loading of multiple ranges of characters.

View clipping.

Merge scenes from two or more scene files
	SceneResource to have a set of "includes", so that merging multiple .scene files is done automatically.

Tags
	Consider special methods on Tagged and TagManager to use inline reified typed methods to return Roles of the
		specified type.
	Maybe also using a Class as the tag.
	How about finding roles with tag x AND tag y. Tag x OR tag y?
		Or should this be done by the client?
	Nearby - Only return those in a the surrounding N blocks.
		N=0 when it will be used for collision detection.
		Create a new TaggedRole interface.

Later
=====

JBox2d integration

Auto detection of a grid to aid splitting a texture into Pose's rectangles.

Split the project into multiple modules
	core
	demo
	editor

Load pose meta-data from SVG files.
	Any objects with a name pose_XXX, where XXX is the pose name.
	Can get the offesetX,Y from the object's center of rotation.
	Can still use GIMP, by linking pngs and exporting the pngs from GIMP.

Scene Editor


Much Later
==========

When adding an actor to a scene, also add child actors as dictated by the costume

StageConstraint

New Game Wizard
	Choice of a completely blank project, or a "Hello World"
	Hello World will have a font, a Play director and a Splash director
		Splash will display some simple text and a button to lauch "level01"
		Maybe also have a "Me" Role

Code Templates
	Create one of Director, Role, Tags
