Current Work
============

Next
====

Don't crash when starting a scene which doesn't exist.

More levels in puzzle picnic.
Copy existing levels, and make the original easier

Restart button always visible???
And Exit button???

BUGS
====

Allow scaling of circles - convert to a polygon if the scale factors are different

InputPicker :
	Java FX key code name "Number Sign" does not map to anything in enum class Key
	"Windows" is this meta?
	Shift, Control, alt etc don't work either.

Possible Optimisations
----------------------

PixelOverlapping
	Don't clear the whole overlapTexture
	Consider making "lineTexture" a smaller, fixed width, and doing a nested loop over x.

New Features
------------

Support enums as attributes.

Message Button, calls Director or Producer

Edit Shape enclosed in a scroll pane, and Pose can be scaled.

Option to load textures only when needed.

Editor to allow resources to be reloaded.

Key input to have a "ghosting" test, where multiple key presses are displayed, to help avoid certain key combinations.

In-Game input mapper, allowing user to change existing inputs (but not add new ones).
	JavaFX or OpenGL?
	OpenGL
		Game is not reliant on JavaFX or Paratask
		Can use LWJGL's input stuff, therefore no confusion over keyboard mappings.
		Harder to code though.

Allow text style to be overriden in the SceneEditor.
	Only save the overridden values if they differ from the Costume's values.

Editor
	Allow a texture to be reloaded (Texture and ImageCache).
	
	Prevent deletion of textures used by a pose
	Prevent deletion of poses used by a costume

	Pose tab to have a list of costumes using it
		In a "minor tab"?
		Or just a button which opens all costumes using that pose.

Ensure Textures are deleted when removed from resources (Use finalise?).

Later
=====

TextStyle to have an extraSpacing property which causes letters to be moved further appart
	Ditto for extra line height.

Game based on "flocking" :	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M028vafB0l8

Split the project into multiple modules
	core
	demo
	editor

RevealStageView
	Age Of Empires style outline of actors hidden behind buildings.
		Use a z buffer?
	Render all buildings and movables in one pass as a normal IsometricStageView (ordered based on Actor's Y position)
		Render all movables to an off-screen buffer using their outline images. (Tagged "REVEAL")
		Render all buildings to an off-screen buffer using just their masks (Tagged "HIDES")
		Combine the two using logical AND
		Render the result to the window.
	Note. when rendering the outlines, it would be nice to do this in two stages, one for a white outline,
	and again for a coloured thinner image coloured based on who's side the character belongs to.
	Rather than have multiple overlapping views, have one compound view, so that we only need to scroll the compound view.

Fog of War
	Filter which objects to render based on their proximity to friendly units.
	Note, this should NOT be a StageView, but a new interface RoleFilter.
	The default filter should be NoFilter, which always returns true.

ChartedStageView
	Draw the scenery to an off-screen buffer (no alpha channel?)
	Keep a "charted" image (scaled so that it isn't HUGE) : white blobs on a black background.
	Keep track of all roles' positions given by a RoleFilter.
	If they have moved since the last frame, draw to the charted image.
	If the role is of type CircularSight, then get the radius, otherwise use a default radius.
	Later, I could check for CustomeSight, and let the Role do the drawing (So objects can "see" in given directions for example).
	Merge using logical AND

Chart
    Add support for creating a chart (a mini view of the world)
    Updated every N frames.
    If the Role is of type Chartable, then get the image using Chartable.chartPose(), otherwise ignore it.
    Uses a RoleFilter to decide which roles are included on the chart.
    Maybe have a ChartableRoleFilter, so that it can only return Chartable Roles.
    If not, then emit a warning the first time a non-chartable role is returned.

Much Later
==========

New Game Wizard
	Choice of a completely blank project, or a "Hello World"
	Hello World will have a font, a Play director and a Splash director
		Splash will display some simple text and a button to lauch "level01"
		Maybe also have a "Player" Role
    Create an intellij project automatically?
