Current Work
============

Add some "solid" objects, and use overlap detection to kill the sparks.
	Just as a prelude to pixel collision detection.

Pixel Overlap
	Find the intersection of their world rectangles
	Render the two object one in red, the other blue

BUGS

New Features
============

Editor

	Prevent deletion of textures used by a pose
	Prevent deletion of poses used by a costume

	Pose tab to have a list of costumes using it
		In a "minor tab"?
		Or just a button which opens all costumes using that pose.

When renaming an item, who's name is used in a scene, we need to keep track of renamed items,
	and update all scenes when the resource file is saved.
	Costume and Font only?

Mouse
	Hide the mouse, so it can be replaced by an actor
	Find Actors at a point
		Overlapping, or using pixel data

Ensure Textures are deleted when removed from resources (Use finialise?).


Costumes to inherit?
	Just the events?

Fonts
	Allow loading of multiple ranges of characters.

View clipping.

Merge scenes from two or more scene files
	SceneResource to have a set of "includes", so that merging multiple .scene files is done automatically.

Tags
	Consider special methods on Tagged and TagManager to use inline reified typed methods to return Roles of the
		specified type. Hmm, can't do that - It will still need a cast, so reified isn't helpful.
	Maybe also using a Class as the tag.
	How about finding roles with tag x AND tag y. Tag x OR tag y?
		Or should this be done by the client?
	Nearby - Only return those in a the surrounding N blocks.
		N=0 when it will be used for collision detection.
		Create a new TaggedRole interface.

Later
=====

JBox2d integration

Auto detection of a grid to aid splitting a texture into Pose's rectangles.

Split the project into multiple modules
	core
	demo
	editor

Load pose meta-data from SVG files.
	Any objects with a name pose_XXX, where XXX is the pose name.
	Can get the offesetX,Y from the object's center of rotation.
	Can still use GIMP, by linking pngs and exporting the pngs from GIMP.

Scene Editor


Much Later
==========

When adding an actor to a scene, also add child actors as dictated by the costume

StageConstraint

New Game Wizard
	Choice of a completely blank project, or a "Hello World"
	Hello World will have a font, a Play director and a Splash director
		Splash will display some simple text and a button to lauch "level01"
		Maybe also have a "Me" Role

Code Templates
	Create one of Director, Role, Tags
